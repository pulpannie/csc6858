Lab 1 Part 1:

Smash Header values. 
in http.c, http_request_header(), value[512] local variable. 
Inside the function, previous stack frame starts at addresss 0x7fff ffff dcd0
current stack frame rbp is stored at 0x7fff ffff dcc0
current stack frame rsp is stored at 0x7fff ffff d880
value[512] array is stored at 0x7fff ffff da90 
so, dcc0 (rbp) - da90 (value array) = 560.

Send header value payload larger than 564 to overwrite return address.
until 560 is the rbp. Next 4 bytes overwrite the return address.
