Lab 1 Part 1:

Smash Header values. 
in http.c, http_request_header(), value[512] local variable. 
Inside the function, previous stack frame starts at addresss 0x7fff ffff dcd0
current stack frame rbp is stored at 0x7fff ffff dcc0
current stack frame rsp is stored at 0x7fff ffff d880
value[512] array is stored at 0x7fff ffff da90 
so, dcc0 (rbp) - da90 (value array) = 560.

Send header value payload larger than 568 to overwrite return address.
until 560 is the rbp. Next 8 bytes overwrite the return address.

Lab 1 Part 2:

for some reason address of value[512] array moved to 0x7fff ffff da80. 
And the rip at 0x7fff ffff dcb8
But still dcb8 - da80 = 568
So, place shellcode in first part of value array, 
shellcode is 69 bytes so add padding 568 - 69
and for the last 8 bytes overwrite the return address to be the start of the value array.
